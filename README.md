# Data Analytics on user behaviour to improve member engagement
We are exploring the amazing world of Data Analytics, in this repository we can find a quick beginner friendly guide to R studio and R language. 
In the R notebook you will find a detailed process to begin with the R programming and RStudio environment, to understand the use of R in Data Analytics, we will start the journey with the open data provided by Google on an hypothetic company called Cyclistic, that has their user data base that include:

- User IDs
- Type of bycicles provided by the company
- Dates of begining and end of travels
- Locations of this travels
- And the type of users

 With this information we will walk through the steps of DATA ANALYSIS:

1. ASK
2. PREPARE
3. PROCESS
4. ANALYZE
5. SHARE
6. ACT
 
Using the R environment with the final objective to come up with a marketing strategy to engage the casual users to become an anual member depending on the findings of the Data Analysis.
  
So then... if you wish, embark with me on this journey of data analysis and learning a new programming language. :D
